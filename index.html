    # Privacy Policy for Family Loop

    **Last Updated:** December 24, 2024

    ## Introduction

    Family Loop ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

    ## Information We Collect

    ### Information You Provide
    - **Account Information:** Email address, display name, and profile information when you create an account
    - **Interaction Logs:** Records of communication you manually log with your contacts (dates, types, notes)
    - **Goals and Events:** Communication goals and family events you create in the app

    ### Information Automatically Collected (With Your Permission)
    - **Contacts:** Names and phone numbers from your device's contact list
    - **Call Logs:** Call history to automatically detect when you've called contacts (Android only)
    - **SMS Messages:** Text message metadata (date, contact) to automatically detect communication (Android only)

    ## How We Use Your Information

    We use your information to:
    - Filter and organize your contacts intelligently
    - Track your communication patterns with family and friends
    - Automatically detect phone calls and text messages (if you enable this feature)
    - Calculate relationship health scores and provide insights
    - Send reminders about communication goals
    - Sync your data across your devices (via Firebase)

    ## Data Storage and Security

    ### On-Device Processing
    - **Call logs and SMS data are processed entirely on your device**
    - We do NOT upload your call logs, SMS content, or raw contact data to our servers
    - Only anonymized interaction metadata (timestamps, contact IDs) is stored in the cloud

    ### Cloud Storage (Firebase)
    We store the following in Google Firebase:
    - Your account information (email, display name)
    - Interaction logs you create (date, type, optional notes)
    - Communication goals and family events
    - Relationship insights and scores

    All cloud data is:
    - Encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
    - Encrypted at rest
    - Protected by Firebase Authentication
    - Only accessible to your account

    ## Permissions We Request

    ### Required Permissions
    - **Contacts (READ_CONTACTS):** To load and filter your contact list

    ### Optional Permissions (You Control)

    **Important:** You can use Family Loop without granting call log or SMS permissions. These are optional features for automatic tracking. You can always track interactions manually.
